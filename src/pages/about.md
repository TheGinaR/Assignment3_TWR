# About

<br/>

This site is all about assignment 3 for the Developing Technical Documentation class in the Technical Writing program. This assignment is intended to show that I successfully learned how to use Markdown, HTML, CSS and how to navigate JavasScript thanks to online documentation and teaching sources. <br/><br/>



### Who Made This



Me, [Gina Roberts](http://localhost:3000/contact_information). The person trapped in the microsite. I can't seem to find a way out. <br/>

### How Did Assignment 3 Come to Be



I figured out how to make this website by following the requirements outlined in the assignment; using documentation from [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs), [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en), and [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#links); and doing tutorials from [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp).
